      BIO
    </p>

    <body>Sam Cooke was a trailblazing recording artist who helped shape the soul and pop scene with hits like "You Send Me," "Cupid" and "A Change Is Gonna Come. Born on January 22, 1931, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, he was the fifth of eight children of the Rev. Charles Cook, a minister in the Church of Christ (Holiness), and his wife, Annie Mae. Cooke was married twice. His first marriage was to singer-dancer Dolores Elizabeth Milligan Cook in 1953; they divorced in 1958, she was later killed in an auto collision in Fresno, California. In 1958, Cooke married his second wife, Barbara Campbell Cooke in Chicago. They had three children, Linda, Tracy, and Vincent. Tragically Cooke died at the age of 33 on December 11, 1964, at the Hacienda Motel, in Los Angeles, California. He had sustained a gunshot wound to the chest, which was later determined to have pierced his heart. He was shot by the hotel manager that claims Cooke broke into the office in a rage and she shot him in self defense. Although nobody knows the exact series of events that resulted in Cooke being shot many still question the statements given by the hotel manager, owner, and woman he was with prior to the shooting. After Cooke's death he was later inducted as a charter member into the Rock & Roll hall of fame in 1986, inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987, and was even honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994.  </body>
