      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>When I was younger I didnt focus or put forth much effort when it came to my studies. 

          I gave little thought to my future and what I really wanted out of life. Instead, I've followed the opportunites that have presented themselves and focused at working hard. While this so far has
          enabled me to make a comfortable life for myself, I am inspired by my family to continue to grow and learn. This is my main reason I would like to become a web developer. It is very 
          important to me that I am able to make them proud. 
          
          I've always really enjoyed working with numbers, problem solving and coming up with creative solutions, so naturaly I was drawn to web development and coding. 
          Web development is a high demand and continuously evolving industry. I feel as though coding could be the beginning of my growth, that will lead me to countless opportunities 
          within the tech world.
